# scrapers
These repository is where I store the scraper I create.
You can find:

 - (another) AirBnb scraper as notebook. It's very easy (Selenium + Beatiful Soup) but effective. Extract the location not always works, It should be implemented a "Scroll to path" like command that I was not able to do. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/edoglione/scrapers/blob/main/airbnb_scraper.ipynb">link</a>. The scraped data are loaded too.
 
 - <a href="https://github.com/edoglione/scrapers/blob/main/EV_Milano_nb.ipynb">Milan electric vehicle charging stations scrapers</a>. The notebook is able to retrieve the location of a ev charging station from Google Maps. It works specifically with the informations related to the city of Milan using the main <a href="https://github.com/edoglione/scrapers/blob/main/ds964_nil_wm.geojson">borroughs centroid coordinates</a>.
